msgid "to reinsert or delete subdirectories that were inserted with explicit switches can bypass Dired's machinery for remembering (or forgetting) switches.  Deleting a subdirectory using @code{dired-undo} does not forget its switches.  When later reinserted using @kbd{i}, it will be reinserted using its old switches.  Using @code{dired-undo} to reinsert a subdirectory that was deleted using the regular Dired commands (not @code{dired-undo})  will originally insert it with its old switches.  Reverting the buffer, however, will relist it using the buffer's default switches.  If any of this yields problems, you can easily correct the situation using @kbd{C-u i} or @kbd{C-u l}."

Inserting a subdirectory with switches that include the @code{R} switch is equivalent to inserting each of its subdirectories using all remaining switches.  For instance, updating or killing a subdirectory that was inserted with the @code{R} switch will not update or kill its subdirectories."
