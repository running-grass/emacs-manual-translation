"Emacs no longer uses @acronym{GMP}, the GNU Multiple Precision library, and "
"doesn't support Lisp integers greater than @code{most-positive-fixnum} or "
"smaller than @code{most-negative-fixnum}.  We now have only one kind of a "
"Lisp integer.  This simplifies many Lisp programs that use integers, and "
"makes integer calculations always fast.  If you want larger values, use Lisp "
"floats, as Emacs has done since day one."

"We have removed support for building with the Jansson library, and "

"intend to remove even that, as useless bloat."

"The ``portable dumper'' feature is gone.  We are once again using the field-"

"to record their random customization experiments on disk, and restore them "
"the next time they start Emacs? And true Emacsers don't restart their Emacs "

"We dropped the support for @acronym{XDG}-style configuration directories and "

"place where Emacs looks for its init files: the @file{~/.emacs.d} directory, "
"with the @file{~/.emacs} file as fallback.  We think this will go a long way "
"towards preventing confusion among users who for some reason have "
"@env{XDG_CONFIG_HOME} set, thus risking to have their init files randomly "
"spread between two places.  In one of the past Emacs versions, we intend to "
"further simplify this, removing the @file{~/.emacs.d} place and leaving only "
"@file{~/.emacs}; stay tuned."

"expected to be of that kind) will have no trouble keeping the minibuffer "
"text in their minds, and typing the responses without actually seeing the "

"Displaying line numbers for a buffer is only possibly using add-on features, "
